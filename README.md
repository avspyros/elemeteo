# elemeteo

### A very basic Weather App made with React.

Search any city and get the following:

- Current temperature and min max temperatures (in Celsius).
- Current weather symbolized by the api icons and a description on icon hover.
- Current date and time of the searched location.
- Background changes to colors according to the searched location.
- Default city is Athens (GR).

The Project began as a means to learn React and Api fundamentals but will be updated in the future to include weather forecast and other useful features.
The APIs used are: Geocoding and Current Weather Data from OpenWeather.

_This is the dev build and api key has not been pushed to repository for security reasons._
